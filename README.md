## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://interactive-pricing-component-onome.netlify.app]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learnt the functions of a range slider and a toggle switch, styling without a CSS framework, using media queries and also how to use css webkits appearance.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: none; && display: block;
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to advance my styling skills by learning and practicing CSS, SASS and other CSS frameworks, also improve my react knowledge and develop my skills as a front-end developer.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for styling and using html needed for the app.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62725470/creat-range-slider-in-react-js) - This is an amazing question and answer that made me finally understood how to use a range slider. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
